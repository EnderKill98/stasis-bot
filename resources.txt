Tested for smooth operation with pathfinding on hetzner:
 - AARCH64 Shared 8 Cores:
   - A instance with 25 accounts works fine (4 worker threads, 1 async compute thread per account)
 - X64 Dedicated 8 Cores:
   - 2 instances with 25 accounts each works fine (per instance: 4 worker threads, 1 async compute thread per account)

Actually worker threads seem to depend on how many players are around:
  - The rough math seems to be 1 worker thread per 6 estimated players around sending packets (double this for arm cores)
