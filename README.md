# stasis-bot

This azalea-bot can automatically detect thrown pearls and later walk there and pull them for you.

The bot needs no configuration. Only the server ip where to connect to.

Currently the bot is using offline mode, since the intended server doesn't support this mc version anyway and [azalea-viaversion](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea-viaversion) seems broken rn.

So tell it connect to connect to [ViaProxy](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy/releases), which you should log into the actual account and specify the actual server ip at.

   - Log into the account you want to use
   - Specify the actual server ip you wanna use
   - Click "Start"
 - Run this program and specify the address of ViaProxy (e.g. 127.0.0.1:25568)
 - Profit
